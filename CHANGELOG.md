# 1.0.0 - First Release
* Got basic highlighting working for braces, brackets, and parens

# 1.0.1 - Cleanup Readme
* Cleaned up the Readme

# 1.1.0 - Changed name
* We used to be skittles (see https://github.com/atom/apm/issues/792)
* Now we're Prismatic Parens

# 1.1.1 - Fixed toggle
* Toggling off doesn't clear the events, so I made colorize do nothing when toggled off
